I recommend downloading the following:
Iron (Browser[Internet])
Sauerbraten(Cube 2)(Online FPS[Games])
Notepad++(Text editing[Development])
Blender(3D manipulation[Graphics and Pictures])

To install these apps, go to the middle right of the panel and click on Apps, Get more apps, By category. The browse for what you want.
